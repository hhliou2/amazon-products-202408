# Amazon Title Quality Prediction Model

Amazon is well known for its varied quality in its products -- while it often shelves reputable brands who've built their recognition through years of good products and service, it is no stranger to copycats emerging with unbelievably low pricing, predatorily enticing the average consumer to purchasing cheaper and often shoddy recreations. This project aims to find a correlation between product titles and lower reviews -- such a model can potentially be used on newly added unreviewed items to push more legitimate or reputable products to Amazon's forefront.
